    <h1>SUSHI</h1>
    <p>
      Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese
      dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some
      sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients (ねた, neta), such
      as seafood, often raw, and vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combination of fresh fish, rice, and vegetables makes for a truly
      unique and amazing culinary experience. Whether you are eating nigiri or
      maki rolls, there is no doubt that sushi is one of the best culinary
      experiences out there.

    <h2>INGRIDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Rice</li>
      <li>Nori(Sea weed)</li>
      <li>Fish</li>
      <li>vegetables</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook rice in water until it boils. ...</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, chop filling into strips or sticks.</li>
      <li>Mix sugar and vinegar. ..</li>
      <li>On your sushi bamboo mat, spread out 1 sheet of nori.</li>
      <li>Cover it as thinly as you can with the rice mixture. .</li>
      <li>
        In the centre of the nori, lay out horizontal lines of your filling (eg.
        a line of salmon and a line of cucumber). Don’t overload your sushi with
        filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now for the tricky part. Grip the mat firmly in both hands and roll up
        sushi as tight as you can. The mat will help you apply even pressure
        along the roll. Note: don’t roll up the mat into the sushi!
      </li>
      <li>Wet the rice-free strip of nori and ‘glue’ it to the sushi roll.</li>
      <li>
        Chop the roll into 1¼" slices – you’re done! Repeat steps 4-9 with
        different fillings for the remaining 3 sheets of nori. You will get
        better with every roll!
