    <h1>BEEF JERKY</h1>
    <p>
      Beef jerky usually only contains beef, salt, sugar, and other seasonings
      or spices. The process of making beef jerky starts with slicing large cuts
      of meat into smaller strips. Then, the meat is marinated in seasonings for
      a long period of time
    </p>
    <p>
      Both beef jerky and chips are both salty, savory, and delicious snacks.
      Beef jerky, however, is a much healthier option than chips with less
      calories, less fat, less carbs, and more protein.
