    <h1>THE LASAGNA</h1>
    <p>
      lasagna, pasta dish of Italian origin, made with broad often ruffled
      noodles and a tomato or white sauce. Lasagna, in the singular, is a
      southern Italian variation of what northern Italians call lasagne, in the
      plural.
    </p>

    <p>
      Originally, in Italy, the word “lasagna” did not refer to a food. The word
      “lasagna” referred to the pot in which the food was cooked.
